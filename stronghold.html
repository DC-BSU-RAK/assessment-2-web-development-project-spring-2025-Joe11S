                    <p>
                        Fresh out of the <span style="color: #7F00FF">portal</span>. Neat.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With your ender pearls and blaze rods, use it to craft <span style="color: lightgreen">eyes of ender</span>!
                        Throw your new eyes of ender, and it will fly to where <span class="emphasis">something should be hiding somewhere.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, there is <span class="emphasis">an even faster way to find a stronghold</span>. Take note on the <span class="emphasis">coordinate and viewing angle</span> where you throw the first eye.
                        Walk a couple of blocks away. Note down the coordinate and viewing angle where you throw the second eye.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using the viewing angles and the coordinates, <span class="emphasis">with the power of trigonometry</span>, you can approximate the location of the stronghold!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Just either follow the eye, or head to the purported location of the stronghold. You might need to watch out for monsters
                        on the way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once you arrived, dig down. If you still couldn't find the stronghold, use <span style="color:red;">TNT's</span>! If you see stone bricks, it means
                        that <span class="emphasis">you have found a stronghold</span>! Find the stronghold portal room, and <span class="emphasis">place the eyes of ender in the portal frame</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you still don't have enough eyes of ender, do one of these three things again: kill endermen, or build a nether
                        portal that connects to the stronghold. Find a warped forest and kill endermen, or barter with piglins for ender pearls.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Get enough eyes of ender (12), to <span class="emphasis">activate the portal</span>. Jump on it to enter <span class="emphasis">the End</span>.
                    </p>

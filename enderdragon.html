                <section class="content">
                    <p>
                       <span class="emphasis">This is the endgame</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       You spawn on a platform and one of the two things happen - either you spawn inside the island, which you
                       must <span class="emphasis">mine your way out</span>, or you spawn way off the island, which you must build a bridge to it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       Once on the island, you'll be greeted with <span class="emphasis">ten obsidian towers</span>, and they have crystals on top, which
                       <span class="emphasis">heals the dragon</span> if they are not destroyed.
                    </p>
                    <p>                        
                       To destroy the crystals, climb up to the top of the tower and <span class="emphasis">hit it</span> to destroy them. Watch out though as they
                       <span class="emphasis">explode</span> on destruction, so <span class="emphasis">use blocks</span> and go behind them to block the explosion. To climb down, use <span style="color: blue;">water</span> buckets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       Alternatively, you can also <span class="emphasis">shoot down the crystals with a bow, snowball or egg</span>, though two of the crystals are <span class="emphasis">encased
                       in cages</span> so you might have to do the former.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       Once the crystals are destroyed, <span class="emphasis">shoot the ender dragon down</span> until its health bar (shown on top), reaches zero. If the
                       Ender Dragon starts perching down, use a sword or axe to <span class="emphasis">slash</span> at the Ender Dragon. Doing this at the <span class="emphasis">head</span> increases the damage
                       dealt. Alternatively, you can use <span class="emphasis">BEDS</span> to dramatically speed up the process, though <span class="emphasis">this has a risk of killing you</span> if not careful.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       Keep on damaging the dragon until its health reaches <span class="emphasis">zero</span>! Once you did, you have defeated the dragon!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       This is the end of speedrunning Minecraft. Hope you read them all.

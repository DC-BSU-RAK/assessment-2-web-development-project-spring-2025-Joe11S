                    <p>
                        The first thing one needs to find are either of the two ways - <span style="color: skyblue;">diamonds</span> or <span style="color: orangered">lava lake</span>, the latter is used
                        to speedrun the game!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once you find a lava lake, use <span style="color: blue">water</span> and <span style="color: orangered">lava</span> buckets in very quick succession to build a portal.
                        Craft a <span class="emphasis">flint and steel</span> with flint found from gravel, and light it to <span style="color: #7F00FF">start a portal</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you're very lucky, you might <span class="emphasis">end up directly ON a fortress</span>. If not, find one. If you spawn in
                        basalt deltas, <span class="emphasis">good luck traversing through that</span>. <span style="color: cyan">Warped</span> and <span style="color: crimson">Crimson</span> forests are of great help as they
                        offer a source of wood (on Crimson forests, watch out for <span style="color: peachpuff">hoglins and piglins</span>. Keep an eye on the <span style="color: peachpuff">latter</span>
                        as they are of great help later!)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once you found a fortress, find <span style="color: yellow">blazes</span>. Better yet, find a <span style="color: yellow">blaze spawner</span>! Use your acquired swords and food
                        to slice down blazes for your coveted <span style="color: yellow">blaze rods</span>! Try to get <span class="emphasis">at least 8-10</span>. If you do, leave the fortress.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can do one of these three things - <span style="color: #7F00FF">leave the portal</span> and kill a bunch of endermen for <span style="color: darkgreen">Pearls</span>, use the warped forest if you found one and kill a bunch of endermen for <span style="color: darkgreen">Pearls</span>, or if
                        you already found a bastion, use it to barter with piglins for <span style="color: darkgreen">PEARLS</span>! If no bastion, but you have found
                        a crimson forest, use the Piglins there to barter with a LOT of <span style="color: yellow">gold</span>, for <span style="color: darkgreen">PEARLS</span>!
                    </p>
                    <p>                        
                        Leave the portal once you got enough pearls to <span class="emphasis">make eyes of ender to locate a stronghold</span>.
